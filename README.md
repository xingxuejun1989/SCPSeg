# SCPSeg

Official implementation of **SCPSeg**, a scene-level geometric primitive segmentation method for outdoor building point clouds.

---

## Introduction

This repository contains the code for SCPSeg, which targets efficient and accurate geometric primitive segmentation on large-scale scene point cloud models.

---

## BGeoSeg Dataset

To evaluate primitive segmentation performance on scene-level point cloud models, we construct the **BGeoSeg** dataset.

BGeoSeg contains **125 outdoor building models**, including residential, office, commercial, cultural, and industrial buildings.  
The models exhibit diverse structural complexity and geometric characteristics, reflecting real-world architectural scenes.  
Each model is annotated with geometric primitive labels.
